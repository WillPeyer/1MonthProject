# 1MonthProject

This one month project dubbed "Elmo's Revenge" is a a simple game about shooting cookies into cookie monster's mouth. The swarm of Cookie Monsters spawn on the rights side of the screen, and you must click so the cookie's trajectory coming out of Elmo on the left side of the screen matches that of the Cookie Monsters.
